In this article, I will provide a step-by-step demonstration of the process of dockerizing your micro-services project with Lumen and Laravel alongside with nginx as a web server and mysql. This is the first part of a three article series.
This initial part will allow us to set up the foundation of our project, dockerize its main components and to establish the basics in order to make a fluid communication between all components.
